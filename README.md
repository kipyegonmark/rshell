# rshell
A basic command shell as part of the course work for [ucr-cs100](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/ucr-cs100/)

This exercise was purely to understand the functioning of a shell and is heavily influenced by this [tutorial](http://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) with credit to [brenns10](https://github.com/brenns10).
